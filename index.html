                <p>Hi! I Am Meenal Subramanian."Successful Projects Begin With The Right Development Team".
                    A front-end developer's role is to combine design and business logic to achieve a user-facing
                    product.

                    user is breathing down your neck to release the next feature. But let me show you why it is
                    worthwhile to focus on what you check in and how it will save you time in the long run.
                    Continue reading The Professional Developer Series.
                    And then you find a problem that challenges your understanding of the framework and you begin
                    questioning yourself. Well, this is precisely one of those times.</p>
